If you are sending a bug report please copy the log file and tell me where it crashed
Using 2.0.1.0-LogUpdate will crash. Do not message me about it.
Please read all bugs (both issues and known bugs in readme) before posting. I do not want duplicates [waste my time to read them]
Please also read the TODO. It will help save time

Please insure that you are using the latest version before posting. If you are not please download it.
If you are using the Auto-Updater, ensure that you are using version 1.0.1.0 and replace it if you are not

We will also be in this IRC if you need help: http://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/#LegendaryClient
