LegendaryClient
===============

Beautiful, fully-featured League of Legends client.

Still under heavy development! Lots of things don't work or don't look good...

Prerequisites
=============

Currently you must have an up-to-date installation of League of Legends. It will not patch to the latest version, but it will retrieve your current data from your current installation

Build it yourself
=================

You need these DLLS:

* Awesomium
* MahApps.Metro
* SharpZipLib
* Sqlite
* PVPNetConnect
