Beautiful, fully-featured League of Legends client.

Still under heavy development (Some things are going great)!
Things are starting to work well and thanks to mhn things are starting to look awesome

Working on a patcher to patch Sightstone and League of Legends (You will no longer need riot's patcher)


#####LEGENDARYCLIENT IS NOW OVER 1 YEAR OLD SINCE FIRST CODE COMMENT BY SNOWL!!!

Only a lot more to go

How To Install
==============
We are working on a new install method (Which will make Sightstone eaasier to install). 

Please wait until vesion 4.0.0.0 comes out (You guys will be happy with this version. Trust me)

I will test Sightstone before this release. This means I will enter a ranked game, normal game, custom game, test game invites and basically every function and page will be tested to not crash (NA).

Q&A
===
Where is LegendaryClient?

LegendaryClient has been renamed to Sightstone.

---

This client sucks, how to uninstall

The installer isn't finished yet, if you could install it without this than you can uninstall without it (just delete the folder)

---

Where is the ranked exploit?

<div class="reddit-embed" data-embed-media="www.redditmedia.com" data-embed-parent="false" data-embed-live="true" data-embed-created="2015-07-23T04:01:43.705Z"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/323d6w/exploit_multiqueue_for_solo_ranked_matchmaking/cq85b85">We're on top of this.
It's also extremely easy to detect, and players will permanently lose their accounts for trying this.</a>

Known Issues / TODO
===================
* Team Builder is not implemented / superbuggy
* Replays are in work
* Shop is just bad, but that's like last. (again, use official client for now if you need to purchase RP, etc.)
* Multi user client (i can only load 3 acc after closing client and restarting)
* FIX CHAT STUFF

Prerequisites
=============
Currently you must have an up-to-date installation of League of Legends. It will not patch to the latest version(todo), but it will retrieve your current data from your current installation

Build it yourself
=================
Just download from git and compile. BTW there is appveyor if you just want to use sightstone without edits
